# Test-web-ripository
This project exists for the sole purpose of education myself the basic principles of ASP.NET CORE. How does it work, how to use query the database, basic front-end vanilla stuff. My next project will be a 'more serious' website. But I'll get there!

P.S. please highlight any mistakes, I really need constructive critisism to get better :3
